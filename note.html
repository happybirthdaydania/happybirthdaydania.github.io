            <p>
               I'm not sure where to begin. It's only been a few months since we've known each other, but 
               I've grown to admire(and love) you soooo much. I've never written a birthday note before and after thinking about it
               for ages, I decided the best way to express how I feel is to give you a list of all the things I love about you.
               So here goes:
            </p>
            <p>
                You care. You care so much. About so many things, and so many people. I love how you always make sure your Ammi is involved
                in your life. I love how you make so much effort to stay in touch with your brothers and all your friends. I love that you
                always make sure to make time for me. I love that you're always there when people need you. You're a great friend, sister, and 
                daughter. And you're the best partner in the world, I literally could not have imagined anything better.
            </p>
            <p>You're resilient. Life has sometimes been very unkind to you, and I love that you continue to keep trying your best despite that. I love that 
                behind all the jokes and kms's, you're still an idealist and you continue to hope despite everything. And I know things will work out
                for you, because you'll keep trying until they do.
            </p>                
            <p>
                You're so responsible. I admire that so much, and I don't think I've told you this enough. You handle everything at
                home so well. I love how independent you are. How you have systems in place for everything, and how you're always able to
                figure out a way even when you dont. I know it's not easy when it's just you and your ammi and you two have to manage everything 
                together, but you make it look so comfortable and warm.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're smart and competent and hardworking. I am not exaggerating even the tiniest bit when I say I am genuinely inspired everyday
                by your work ethic. I have been since I stalked you on linkedin and saw you'd been working since 3rd year. I am even more inspired
                by how you burn the midnight oil to make sure all your work is done. You're an asset to anyone who's lucky enough to ever work with
                you and I'm so glad your current company sees that and appreciates you. And I know you'll do amazing things in your career and I 
                can't wait to see it.
            </p>                
            <p>
                You're curious. I love that you google everything the moment you come across it. I love how broad your interests are. I 
                love that you have a youtube channel and an inactive celebrity fan page. I love how much I enjoy talking to you, not just because 
                you're a great communicator (you are). I love how you always have something useful or insightful or funny to say. I love how practical
                your suggestions are. I love how you're always trying to know more, and learn more. I love how much better you are at connections than
                me. (I'm so excited for when we start doing presentations because I just know I'm gonna learn a ton from you.)
            </p>                
            <p>
                You're gorgeous. You are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You're so so so so pretty. I see you everyday and yet everytime I see
                your face I am in awe of it. I feel the dopamine receptors in my brain firing everytime I imagine you. I love your eyes. I love your cute,
                round face. I love your smile (so much). I love when you pout, I love when you laugh, I love when you're annoyed/embarassed when I 
                compliment you. I love how serious your face is when we're working through something. I love how you look at people (especially me :3),
                there's so much love and kindness, and you're SO pretty I cannot explain in words.
            </p>                
            <p>
                You're a great hang. You're sweet, funny, kind. Your smile can brighten anyone's day. You're fun to talk to, you're accomodating 
                and flexible, you're open to new experiences. You have a calming presence. You're just great to be around <3
            </p>                                
            
            <p>
                dania. cutie. jaan. I love you so much. so, so much. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined things would work out like this.
                Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined how amazing you'd be. Thank you for giving this a shot. Thank you for always listening
                to me yap. Thank you for making me a part of your life and telling me everything that's going on. Thank you for creating a safe space 
                that lets me be vulnerable. Thank you for trusting me with your vulnerabilities. Thank you for communicating, I love the paragraphs so 
                much you have no idea. Thank you for always trying your best. Thank you for being kind.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's insane to look back on the past few months and everything that's happened. I hope you get into the MS programs of your dreams. I hope
                your Ammi ends up in a living situation where she's genuinely happy and you're at peace. I hope you get to see her and your family extremely
                often. I hope you live in a walkable city with multiple friends within walking distance. I hope you get to travel the world and go to concerts
                and experience everything you've ever wanted to. I hope Hasan Raheem takes the Zus brand deal. And I hope I'm there for all of it.
                I hope I'm with you through the joys and the sorrows,
                and the movie nights and the meet work sessions, and the countless wonderful experiences we'll have in the future. I hope I'm writing a
                message like this for you next year, and the next, and the next, for the rest of our lives. I hope you're always mine.
            </p>
